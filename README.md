## 1. Problem Understanding and Dataset Overview
Download the dataset: Kaggle House Prices Dataset.
Understand the problem: What factors affect house prices?
Define goals: Predict house prices as accurately as possible.
## 2. Data Cleaning
Handle missing values: Identify columns with missing data and decide how to handle them (e.g., imputation, removal).
Check for inconsistencies: Look for duplicated rows, outliers, and formatting issues.
Standardize numeric data and clean categorical data.
## 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Visualize distributions of features using histograms or box plots.
Use correlation heatmaps to find relationships between numeric features.
Explore feature importance visually (e.g., how does the size of a house affect price?).
Tools:

Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
## 4. Feature Engineering
Create new features:

Total square footage (combine multiple related features).
Age of the house at the time of sale.
Interaction terms (e.g., number of bathrooms × square footage).
Encode categorical variables using techniques like One-Hot Encoding or Label Encoding.

## 5. Model Building
Train a baseline model (e.g., Linear Regression) to evaluate basic performance.
Experiment with more complex models:
Random Forests, Gradient Boosting (e.g., XGBoost, LightGBM)
Use cross-validation to assess generalization.
Fine-tune hyperparameters using GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV.
Tools:

Scikit-learn, XGBoost, LightGBM
## 6. Model Evaluation
Use metrics like RMSE, MAE, and R² to evaluate performance.
Plot actual vs. predicted prices to understand model fit.
## 7. Insights and Documentation
Summarize findings: Which features are most important for predicting house prices?
Create visualizations to make your results easy to understand.
